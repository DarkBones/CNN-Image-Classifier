    "## The Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the application easy to use for users who might not know a lot about machine learning, I want them to be able to train the model and run the classifier using only 1 command for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training the model:\n",
    "After creating a dataset, users should be able to train a good model using the following command:\n",

    "-clear|If set to 'True', all instances in the training, validation, and test data will be cleared before training the model|True\n",
    "-augmentations|How many times each image should be augmented|25\n",
    "-patience|How many epochs without improvement on validation_loss should occur before the model stops training|20\n",
    "-epochs|The maximum amount of epochs to train the model on|500\n",

    "#### Example:\n",
    ">train.py -clear False -augmentations 5 model_name new_model\n",
    "\n",
    "The example above will not delete any existing data in the training, validation and test sets, it will train the model using 5 augmentations for each image and it will save the model as *new_model.hdf5*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** After the model has been trained, the script will also save a text file with the same name and in the same location as the model containing all the categories. This file can later be read by *process.py* so it knows what categories to use.\n",

    "### Running the model on Images\n",

    "When *process.py* is run, it will create subdirectories for each of the categories and copy the original images to them based on the model's predictions and the processor's threshold."
